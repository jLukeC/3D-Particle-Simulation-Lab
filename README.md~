The Ideal Gas Law describes the characteristics of ideal gas in a
container. Often written as $PV=nRT$, this law displays the relationship
between Pressure, Volume, Temperature, moles of the particle, and the
universal gas constant in a system. The Ideal Gas Law can be derived
from combining three other gas laws: Boyle’s Law, Charles’s Law, and
Avogadro’s Law.
Boyle’s Law postulates that in a system with uniform temperature, the
pressure of an ideal gas is inversely proportional with volume of the
gas. Thus, the pressure times the volume is equal to a constant value in
the system, often shown as $PV = k$ (where k is the constant). Since the
constant is the same no matter the circumstances in the system, the law
can be used to relate changes in pressure or volume as
$P_{1}V_{1} = P_{2}V_{2}$ (where 1 indicates the initial and 2 is the
final state).
