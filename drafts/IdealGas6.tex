\section{Simulating the Relationship Between Pressure and Other
Variables in a 3D Environment}

Luke Carlson\\Trevor Day School\\March 11, 2013

\section{Introduction}

The Ideal Gas Law describes the characteristics of ideal gas in a
container. Often written as $PV=nRT$, this law displays the relationship
between Pressure, Volume, Temperature, moles of the particle, and the
universal gas constant in a system. The Ideal Gas Law can be derived
from combining three other gas laws: Boyle's Law, Charles's Law, and
Avogadro's Law.

Boyle's Law postulates that in a system with uniform temperature, the
pressure of an ideal gas is inversely proportional with volume of the
gas. Thus, the pressure times the volume is equal to a constant value in
the system, often shown as $PV = k$ (where k is the constant). Since the
constant is the same no matter the circumstances in the system, the law
can be used to relate changes in pressure or volume as
$P_{1}V_{1} = P_{2}V_{2}$ (where 1 indicates the initial and 2 is the
final state).

Charles's Law states that in a system with uniform pressure, the
temperature is inversely proportional to the volume of the container
holding the ideal gas ($V \propto T$). Since this law applies to any
variation in volume or temperature, it can be written as
$\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}} = \frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}$

Avogadro's Law declares that in a system with a constant temperature and
pressure, equivalent volumes of the same ideal gas will contain an equal
number of particles. Mathematically, the relationship can be shown using
$\frac{V}{n} = k$ (where k is the constant in the system).

These three laws can be combined mathematically to create
$\frac{PV}{Tn} = R$ (R is a constant in the system). When rearranged,
this creates $PV=nRT$ or the Ideal Gas Law.

\subsection{Purpose}

In this lab, I set out to create a 3D simulation of ideal gas particles
in a cubic container in order to experimentally determine the pressure
of the gas based on given circumstances. From there, I planned to
explore the relationship between pressure and volume as well as pressure
and number of particles.To produce an sumlation, a replication of a real
world circumstance using programming, of a gas particle it is first
necessary to understand exactly how particles affect the pressure of a
system. Pressure is the amount of force over a specific area, also
written as $Pressure=F/A$. Force can also be described as change in
momentum over change in time: $F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$. The
change momentum of a single particle equals its mass multiplied by its
change in velocity: ${\Delta p} = m\Delta v$. Since there is more than
one particle in a system, the entire change in momentum is the combined
change in velocities of each particle that hits the specified area.
Thus, the following formula can be used to determine total force:

~ $F = \frac{2m * \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^n v}{\Delta t}$

Where $n$ is the number of collisions and $v$ is the velocity of the
particle hitting the wall. Since the change in velocity is double the
initial velocity, the 2 can be placed outside the summation along with
the mass.

Once the force has been computed using the momentum of the particles,
the pressure can then be determined with the initial formula $P = F/A$.

\section{Hypothesis}

Increasing the number of particles in the simulation will yield a
greater pressure. Furthermore, increasing the volume of a container will
decrease the pressure in the system.

\section{Method}

To create my simulation, I used Processing, which is an open source
program designed for programming visual projects. Processing uses a form
of the Java programming language

\subsection{Computing Pressure}

I began constructing my simulation with '3D Balls Bouncing', a project
from Open Processing, as a base. Starting off with a system that could
already handle 3D collisions of small objects inside a container was
necessary {[}see Failed Methods{]}. From there, I created small spheres
with the properties of an ideal gas. Their speed was roughly determined
on a Maxwell-Boltzman distribution and assuming that the most probable
speed ($V_{p}$) would occur the most often (calculated using the formula
$V_{p} = \sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}}$. Next, I focused on one wall in the
container and tracked each time a particle collided with the area. I
could then compute the change in momentum over the area since I had the
masses and velocities of the particles. The simulation did not keep
track of total time since initiation, which is equivalent to time, but I
knew that aspects of the code were executed every frame. The project ran
at a fixed number of frames per second (60) so I designed this formula
to figured out the change in time:
$total\ time (seconds) = \frac{total\ frames}{frames\ per\ second}$.

I inserted that data into this formula
$F = \frac{2m * \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^n v}{\Delta t}$ (see
Introduction) to find the total force on the wall. To obtain the
pressure, I just divided the answer by the area of the wall.

\subsection{Testing Pressure vs. Number of Particles}

Now that I was able to compute the pressure, I could test my hypothesis
by increasing the number of particles in the system and analyzing the
pressure readings. I started off with 5 particles and then tried 10, 15,
and 20, 50 and 100 particles. I calculated the total pressure of each
system once every 5 seconds for 20 seconds.

\subsection{Assessing the Relationship Between Pressure and Volume}

The next step of my experiment involved manipulating the volume of the
container while keeping the number of particles constant. In order to do
so, I altered one line of code in the box Class:

\texttt{int boxsize = 300;}

This variable alters the dimensions of the box (currently 300x300x300
pixels). I changed the boxsize to 400, 500, and 600, and calculated the
pressure every 5 seconds for 20 seconds.

Since the simulation could not handle a large number of particles, I

\subsection{Failed Methods}

I originally designed my own 3D collision system but it was less
efficient so a computer could not render as many particles in the
simulation. I knew that my approximation for pressure would be further
off and I also realized that it would be too time consuming to focus on
designing the base of the system when I could use open source
alternatives.

\section{Results}

My data shows that increasing the number of the particles will increase
the pressure of the system. Conversely, expanding the volume of the
container leads to a smaller pressure.

\section{Discussion}

In this lab, I created a 3D simulation to explore the relationship
between pressure and number of particles in a system. In order to do so,
I derived a formula for pressure based on how the particles interact
with a specific section of the container. Next, I tested how increasing
the volume affects the pressure by changing the dimensions of the square
container. The results support my hypothesis: increasing the number of
particles will increase the total pressure and increasing the volume
decreases the pressure.

The results of my simulation can be used to mathematically display the
relationship between these variables (when all other variables remain
constant), as $P \propto V$ and $P \propto 1/N$ ($N$ = number of
particles).

\subsection{Improvements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Since the simulation could not handle a large number of particles, I
  had to resort to using an unrealistically low number of particles
  (e.g. 5 particles vs $5 x 10^{23}$).

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    This also meant that my Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution would not be
    as precise because if a particle obtained a truely outlier speed, it
    would greatly affect the results
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Increasing the number of trials would should a larger picture of the
  correlation between the variables. This would not change the results
  of my trial but the added data would create a larger foundation of
  evidence\ldots{}
\item
  Allowing the variables to change as the simulation runs would be an
  interesting addition to the project and could provide helpful visuals.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Going Further}

My simulation can be altered or tweaked to explore many characteristics
of ideal gases. For example, I could test Boyle's Law, which states that
pressure and volume are directly proportional. To do so, I would keep
the the number of particles the same and alter the pressure and volume.
The hard part of testing Boyle's Law would be to derive exactly $how$
pressure affects volume and vice versa.

Charles's Law, which argues that increasing the temperature will
increase the volume, could be tested using my simulation as well. I
would change the temperature of the system, keep the pressure constant,
and track the change in volume. Similarly, I could experimentally
determine the relationship between temperature and pressure when volume
remains constant.

Besides using the simulation to provide evidence for these two ideal gas
laws, it can be used to understand other ones. If the user accepts that
pressure and volume are directly proportional, they can test the
Combined Gas Law. This law argues that the constant created within
Boyle's Law ($PV = k$) is inversely proportional to the temperature of
the system. This can be written as $\frac{PV}{T} = K$ (K is a system
constant)
